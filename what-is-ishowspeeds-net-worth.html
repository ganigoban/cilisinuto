In 2022, he was named Breakthrough Streamer of the Year at the 12th Streamy Awards.</p><p>He joined YouTube in 2016, occasionally uploading gameplay videos. Around December 2017, IShowSpeed began streaming and uploading videos from games like NBA 2K and Fortnite but only attracted two viewers on average. Eventually, his subscribers grew within a few months, reaching 100,000 subscribers in April 2021, 1 million in June 2021, and 10 million in July 2022.</p><p>IShowSpeed began broadcasting in 2019. He rose to fame in 2021 after his fan base started posting clips on TikTok of his often violent behavior while streaming his game, players, and cameras. Well, this became popular and became a meme. His outburst led to bans on the video game streaming platform Twitch and the video game Valorant.</p><p>Kotaku has described IShowSpeed as “one of the biggest and fastest-growing streamers” on YouTube. One game that has significantly contributed to its growing popularity is Talking Ben. IShowSpeed’s videos on Talking Ben the Dog have been credited with bringing new popularity to the mobile app, which became the best-selling game on the App Store more than a decade later when first released.</p><p>In July 2022, IShowSpeed set off Pikachu fireworks inside his bedroom, nearly burning him. In August 2022, he was run over during a YouTube live stream, police handcuffed IShowSpeed and his cameraman was forced to end the broadcast. He announced that he was taken to jail and that Adin Ross had to bail him, allowing him to resume streaming on August 11.</p><p>Also in August 2022, he tried to cheat on the “US and the global economy” course he was taking at the Ohio School of Digital Learning by asking viewers for the answers to his test. Instead, his viewers took the opportunity to prank him and intentionally gave him the wrong answer, giving him a 0/10 on the test.</p><p>In September 2022, IShowSpeed played in the Sidemen Charity Football Match. During the match, he expressed frustration with English referee Mark Clattenburg for disallowing his goal for offside. He continued to whip him with the shirt he had taken off in celebration, which earned him a yellow card.</p><p>Later in the game, a pitch intruder wearing Messi’s shirt approached IShowSpeed, prompting him to throw him to the ground. In November 2022, American rapper and singer Lil Nas X made his live debut and appeared on Watkins’ stream. In December 2022, he won the Streamy Award in the “Breakthrough Streaming” category at the 12th Streamy Awards.</p><p>In November and December 2022, IShowSpeed visited various football stadiums to try and watch his idol Cristiano Ronaldo play live. He visited Old Trafford, Craven Cottage, and many other stadiums in Qatar. However, Ronaldo was left out of the squad for these matches, up until Portugal’s loss to Morocco.</p><p>In May 2023, IShowSpeed announced that he had signed an exclusive streaming agreement with video-sharing platform Rumble, in collaboration with Kai Cenat. On 18 June 2023, IShowSpeed met Cristiano Ronaldo in Lisbon, Portugal after a Euro 2024 qualifying match between Portugal and Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p><p>On July 7, 2023, IShowSpeed was a surprise guest at the 2023 Rolling Loud festival in Portugal and performed “Shake”, “World Cup” and “Portuginies” with the support of American rapper Ski Mask the Slump God and DJ Scheme producer.</p><p>In August 2021, IShowSpeed released his debut single, “Dooty Booty”, on his YouTube channel. Once uploaded, the song quickly became popular on YouTube and other social networking sites like TikTok. In November 2021, IShowSpeed released a single called “Shake”, sampling both “Ready or Not” by the Fugees, as well as “Hit The Road Jack” by Ray Charles.</p><p>The song’s accompanying music video has received over 160 million views on YouTube. In June 2022, he released a song called “Ronaldo (Sewey)”, expressing his new admiration for Cristiano Ronaldo. In November 2022, he released a single titled “World Cup” under Warner Records in honor of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much is IShowSpeed Worth?</h2><p>IShowSpeed is a YouTuber, live streamer, and rapper who has a net worth of $10 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much does IShowSpeed earn per month?</h2><p>Social Blade reports IShowSpeed earns an estimated $16,000 monthly on average</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is IShowSpeed a millionaire?</h2><p>Yes, IShowSpeed is a millionaire with a net worth of $10 million</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Car does IShowSpeed drives?</h2><p>IShowSpeed reportedly drives a Porsche 911 Carrera S 992 and a Lamborghini Urus</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Does IShowSpeed own any properties?</h2><p>IShowSpeed might own some properties but there’s no information regarding that</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How did IShowSpeed make his money?</h2><p>IShowSpeed makes his money through his YouTube channel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrCfmqxdnsButdKhprCroJqypb%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-ishowspeeds-net-worth.html&text=What%20is%20IShowSpeeds%20Net%20Worth%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-ishowspeeds-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-ishowspeeds-net-worth.html&title=What%20is%20IShowSpeeds%20Net%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-is-ishowspeeds-net-worth.html&title=What%20is%20IShowSpeeds%20Net%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-ishowspeeds-net-worth.html&title=What%20is%20IShowSpeeds%20Net%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-ishowspeeds-net-worth.html&description=What%20is%20IShowSpeeds%20Net%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-kind-of-clothes-did-jesus-probably-wear.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Kind Of Clothes Did Jesus Probably Wear?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-is-deggi-mirch-called-in-english-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is Deggi Mirch called in English?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
