His net worth at the time of his death was estimated to be around $12 million, which came from his salaries, endorsements, and investments. However, in the years leading up to his passing, Caminiti found himself on the verge of bankruptcy due to his addiction struggles.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Education>Early Life and Education</span></h2><p>Caminiti was born and raised in San Jose, California, and had a troubled childhood. His parents divorced when he was young, and he turned to sports as an outlet for his emotions. He excelled at baseball and football in high school and went on to attend San Jose State University. Caminiti was drafted by the Houston Astros in 1984 after his junior year.</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>Caminiti played for several teams during his 15-year-long career, including the Houston Astros, San Diego Padres, Atlanta Braves, Texas Rangers, and New York Yankees. He was a three-time All-Star and won a Gold Glove Award for his defensive play. In 1996, Caminiti was named the National League’s Most Valuable Player after leading the league in home runs and RBIs.</p><h2><span id=Personal_Life>Personal Life</span></h2><p>Caminiti’s personal life was marked by turmoil and addiction. He struggled with drug and alcohol abuse throughout his career and later admitted to using steroids during his MVP season. Caminiti had three marriages and four children. His third wife filed for divorce just weeks before his death. Caminiti was known for his larger-than-life personality and was loved by teammates and fans alike.</p><h2><span id=Illness_and_Death>Illness and Death</span></h2><p>Caminiti passed away on October 10, 2004, at the age of 41. He suffered a heart attack while visiting his daughter in New York City. Caminiti’s cause of death was later attributed to coronary artery disease, which was likely exacerbated by his long history of drug and steroid use. His death was a shock to the baseball community and served as a stark reminder of the dangers of addiction.</p><h2><span id=Real_Estate>Real Estate</span></h2><p>At the peak of his career, Caminiti purchased a luxurious mansion in La Jolla, California, for $4.2 million. The house had six bedrooms, eight bathrooms, and was situated on a hilltop overlooking the Pacific Ocean. However, in the years leading up to his death, Caminiti was forced to sell the property due to mounting bills and debts.</p><h2><span id=Legacy>Legacy</span></h2><p>Despite his personal struggles, Caminiti was remembered by his fans and colleagues as an exceptional athlete and a kind soul. After his death, the San Diego Padres retired his number 21 jersey in his honor. Caminiti’s legacy, however, is bittersweet. He was one of the first baseball players to openly admit to steroid use, which brought a dark cloud over his career.</p><h2><span id=Frequently_Asked_Questions>Frequently Asked Questions:</span></h2><h3><span id=What_were_some_of_Ken_Caminiti8217s_biggest_achievements_during_his_career>What were some of Ken Caminiti’s biggest achievements during his career?</span></h3><p>Caminiti was a three-time All-Star and won a Gold Glove Award for his defensive play.
