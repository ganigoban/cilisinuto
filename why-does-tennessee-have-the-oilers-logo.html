The Houston Oilers were a member of the AFL and then the NFL from 1960 to 1996. Owned by Bud Adams, the team had unique Columbia blue uniforms and a derrick logo that stood out as a unique brand during their time in Houston. In 1997, Adams relocated the team from Houston to Tennessee, where they were known as the Tennessee Oilers for two years before ultimately becoming the Tennessee Titans. The Titans have chosen to honor the rich history of the franchise by occasionally wearing the Oilers’ uniforms and adopting their logo as a nod to their past.</p><h3>Why are the Titans wearing Oilers jerseys?</h3><p>The Titans are wearing Oilers jerseys as a way to honor the history of the franchise. The Houston Oilers were in the AFL from 1960-69 before moving to the NFL. The franchise played in Tennessee as the Tennessee Oilers from 1997-98, and during that time they wore the Oilers’ uniforms. By wearing the throwback jerseys, the Titans are paying tribute to their roots and acknowledging the unique brand established by the Houston Oilers.</p><h3>Why is Tennessee the Oilers now?</h3><p>Tennessee is not officially known as the Oilers, but they have chosen to honor their history by occasionally wearing Oilers’ jerseys. The franchise was called the Tennessee Oilers from 1997-98 after owner Bud Adams relocated the team from Houston to Tennessee in 1997. The decision to wear the Oilers’ uniforms is a way for the Titans to pay homage to their past and the unique brand established by the Houston Oilers during their time in Houston.</p><h3>Did Tennessee Titans wear Oilers uniforms?</h3><p>Yes, the Tennessee Titans have worn Oilers uniforms in the past. The Titans first wore their Oilers throwbacks in 2018 against the Atlanta Falcons. They have continued to wear them on occasion since then, including a game against the Houston Texans. The Titans have shown a willingness to embrace their history and honor the franchise’s origins by wearing the throwback uniforms.</p><h3>Are the Tennessee Titans the Old Houston Oilers?</h3><p>The Tennessee Titans are not the old Houston Oilers, but there is a historical connection between the two franchises. The Houston Oilers played in Houston from 1960 to 1996 before relocating to Tennessee and becoming the Tennessee Oilers from 1997-98. The franchise ultimately changed its name to the Tennessee Titans in 1999. While the team has adopted the Oilers’ logo and occasionally wears Oilers’ jerseys, they are a separate entity from the old Houston Oilers.</p><h3>The Oilers are coming back and Houstonians aren’t happy</h3><p>There is no indication that the Oilers are coming back as a separate team. The Tennessee Titans occasionally wear Oilers’ jerseys as a way to honor the history of the franchise, but they are not bringing back the Houston Oilers as a separate entity. The decision to wear the Oilers’ jerseys has generated mixed reactions, with some fans in Houston expressing displeasure due to the franchise’s history of relocating from Houston to Tennessee.</p><h3>When did Tennessee change from Oilers?</h3><p>Tennessee changed from being called the Oilers after the 1998 season. The team relocated from Houston to Tennessee in 1997 and played as the Tennessee Oilers for two years before changing its name to the Tennessee Titans before the 1999 season. The change in name reflected the franchise’s desire for a fresh start and a new identity in their new home.</p><h3>Are the Titans bringing back the Oilers uniforms?</h3><p>The Titans have brought back the Oilers uniforms on occasion as throwbacks. During the 2023 season, the Titans celebrated the return of the Oilers’ iconic uniform, honoring the rich history of the franchise. This specific uniform combination was originally worn from 1981-1998, which includes the Oilers’ original tenure in Tennessee. While the Titans occasionally wear the Oilers’ uniforms, it is not a permanent change and they continue to play as the Tennessee Titans.</p><h3>Why did the Titans wear Oilers uniforms?</h3><p>The Titans wore Oilers uniforms as a way to honor the history of the franchise and pay tribute to the unique brand established by the Houston Oilers. The decision to wear the throwback jerseys coincided with the induction of Billy “White Shoes” Johnson into the team’s Ring of Honor, which recognizes legendary players who have played for the franchise in Tennessee and/or Houston. By wearing the Oilers uniforms, the Titans sought to evoke nostalgia and show respect for their past.</p><h3>Why can’t the Texans wear Oilers uniforms?</h3><p>The Texans, Houston’s current NFL team, cannot wear Oilers uniforms because the Oilers and Texans are distinct franchises with their own intellectual property and trademarks. The Houston Oilers relocated to Tennessee and became the Tennessee Titans in 1997, while the Houston Texans are an expansion team that began play in 2002. Each team has its own separate identity and cannot use the logos or uniforms of the other.</p><h3>When did the Houston Oilers change their name to the Tennessee Titans?</h3><p>The Houston Oilers officially changed their name to the Tennessee Titans on November 14, 1998. The decision to change the name came after the franchise relocated to Tennessee in 1997 and played as the Tennessee Oilers for two years. The new name reflected the team’s desire for a fresh start and a new identity in their new home. Since then, the franchise has continued to be known as the Tennessee Titans.</p><h3>What is the Tennessee Oilers new name?</h3><p>The Tennessee Oilers’ new name is the Tennessee Titans. The franchise changed its name from the Tennessee Oilers to the Tennessee Titans before the 1999 season. The new name was chosen to signify a fresh start and a new identity for the team as they established themselves in their new home in Tennessee. Since then, the franchise has continued to be known as the Tennessee Titans.</p><h3>Did Tennessee change their name back to the Oilers?</h3><p>No, Tennessee did not change their name back to the Oilers. After being known as the Tennessee Oilers for two seasons from 1997-98, the franchise changed its name to the Tennessee Titans before the 1999 season. The decision to change the name reflected the team’s desire for a fresh start and a new identity in their new home. While the Titans occasionally wear Oilers throwback jerseys, they have not reverted to using the Oilers name as their primary identity.</p><h3>Why are they called the Tennessee Titans?</h3><p>The Tennessee Titans derived their name from Nashville’s sobriquet of “the Athens of the South.” The franchise was originally known as the Houston Oilers, but when they moved to Tennessee in 1997, they wanted a new identity that reflected their new home. The name “Titans” was chosen to represent strength,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FErJpnm5%2BifKixzqCpmqiYnrBussCqZrCgqWKxsLHSZquepp6awLSxxGafmq6VYsGpsYyooKWdoqh6rbvGqGY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-does-tennessee-have-the-oilers-logo.html&text=Why%20does%20Tennessee%20have%20the%20Oilers%20logo%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-does-tennessee-have-the-oilers-logo.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-does-tennessee-have-the-oilers-logo.html&title=Why%20does%20Tennessee%20have%20the%20Oilers%20logo%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-does-tennessee-have-the-oilers-logo.html&title=Why%20does%20Tennessee%20have%20the%20Oilers%20logo%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-does-tennessee-have-the-oilers-logo.html&title=Why%20does%20Tennessee%20have%20the%20Oilers%20logo%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-does-tennessee-have-the-oilers-logo.html&description=Why%20does%20Tennessee%20have%20the%20Oilers%20logo%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-princess-lilibet-christening-different-prince-archie.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Princess Lilibet's christening was so different from brother Prince Archie's">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./why-did-justin-bieber-go-to-jail.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Did Justin Bieber Go To Jail?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
