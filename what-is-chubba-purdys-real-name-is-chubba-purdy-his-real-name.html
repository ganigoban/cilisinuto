Prior to transferring, he played and committed to Florida State. He is the younger brother of quarterback Brock Purdy of the San Francisco 49ers.</strong></p><p>Chubba Purdy’s given name is Preston, but because of connections from his early years, he went by Chubba. Although his official name is Preston, he goes by Chubba most of the time, which is a moniker that is quite embedded in his personality.</p><p>Chubba Purdy’s real name is Preston. Despite having the name from birth, he became known as “Chubba” as an adult due to his childhood obesity. Despite having the formal name Preston, he preferred to go by the more endearing and well-known nickname “Chubba” because it became a significant aspect of who he was.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is the Real Name of Chubba Purdy?</h2><p>Preston is Chubba Purdy’s true name. Despite being born with the name, he adopted the nickname “Chubba” as an adult because of his childhood obesity. He chose to go by the more lovable and familiar nickname “Chubba” despite having the formal name Preston since it became a big part of who he was. Friends and relatives began using the new name often, which cemented its significance in his life and led to the name change.</p><p>This decision signifies a change from his given name to one that is more popular with others around him and represents his personal connection to the nickname. Therefore, in both the personal and professional worlds, he is referred to as Chubba even though his official name is Preston Purdy.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Chubba Purdy?</h2><p>Born on July 30, 2001, as Preston Purdy, Chubba Purdy is an American football quarterback who plays collegiate football for the Nebraska Cornhuskers. Prior to playing for Florida State in his first season of commitment, he transferred to Nebraska for his sophomore year in 2022. Notably, he took over as the Cornhuskers’ backup quarterback when Jeff Sims won the starting job.</p><p>Chubba’s football career has been shaped by familial ties; she is the younger sibling of 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy. He was given the moniker “Chubba” when he was younger because he was overweight, and he formally accepted it as an adult since many people knew him by then.</p><p>Purdy sat behind his older brother Brock in the first two seasons of the show. He ran for 1,152 yards and 23 rushing touchdowns as a junior in addition to throwing for 3,425 yards and 36 touchdowns. He guided Perry to an 11–3 record and an appearance in the 6A state championship game, which they lost 65–28 to Chandler.</p><p>Purdy finished 2019 as a senior with 52 touchdowns and 4,423 yards of total offense. The Arizona Offensive Player of the Year award went to him. With his assistance, Perry advanced to the 6A state playoff quarterfinals. The group would suffer a 70–63 loss to Desert Vista.</p><p>In 2022, Purdy moved to Nebraska on January 17. Against No. 6 Oklahoma, he made his Nebraska debut. He ran five times for 29 yards, including an eight-yard touchdown, and completed seven of eleven passes for 35 yards, leading the team on one of its two touchdown drives. Before playing the entire second half against No. 17 Illinois, he also played infrequently against Indiana and Rutgers.</p><p>Despite being hurt, he completed three of eight passes against Illinois for fifteen yards. Against Minnesota, he got his first career start while Casey Thompson, the first player, recovered from an injury. He would score a rushing touchdown and account for 65 offensive yards in the first quarter, giving the team a 10-point lead.</p><p>Against No. 3 Michigan, Purdy would start for the second straight week. Despite being forced to leave the game due to an ankle injury that required surgery, he ended as the team’s top passer and runner.</p><p>After recent transfer Jeff Sims and Heinrich Haarberg in the quarterback depth chart, Purdy was third going into the 2023 season for Nebraska. Due to an ankle injury suffered by Haarberg, Purdy was selected as the starting quarterback for Wisconsin’s Week 12 match. Despite Nebraska’s eventual 24–17 overtime loss to Wisconsin, head coach Matt Rhule of Nebraska told the media that he “thought Chubba played really well.”</p><p>Shawn and Carrie Purdy are the parents of Purdy. Prior to being selected by the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League (NFL) as Mr. Irrelevant in the 2022 NFL Draft, his older brother Brock Purdy was a quarterback for Iowa State. Whittney, his elder sister, was a Southeastern softball player. Shawn Purdy, Purdy’s father, was a minor league and University of Miami baseball player.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Chubba Purdy Early Life</h2><p>Born in Queen Creek, Arizona on July 30, 2001, Chubba Purdy excelled in football at Perry High School in Gilbert, Arizona. Notably, for the first two seasons, he performed second fiddle to his elder brother Brock.</p><p>In addition to demonstrating his dual-threat ability as a junior by passing for 3,425 yards and 36 touchdowns, Chubba also ran for 1,152 yards and 23 touchdowns. Perry’s outstanding play earned them an 11-3 record and a spot in the final game, despite a loss to Chandler.</p><p>Purdy maintained his stellar performance in his senior year, compiling a massive 4,423 yards of total offense and 52 touchdowns. Because of his outstanding performance, he was named Arizona Offensive Player of the Year.Chubba Purdy’s incredible high school career came to an end as the team lost to Desert Vista in a high-scoring match, after leading Perry to the quarterfinals of the 6A state playoffs.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Career of Chubba Purdy</h2><p>The ups and downs of Chubba Purdy’s collegiate football career have demonstrated his brilliance and resiliency. In 2019, he committed to Louisville at first, but then changed his mind and chose Florida State.</p><p>Purdy became the fifth true freshman quarterback to start for Florida State in 2020 during his true freshman season. He had a great start to the season, but after making his first professional start, a collarbone injury ended his season.</p><p>His one game in 2021 as a redshirt freshman had a strong showing against UMass, with five completions for 98 yards and two touchdowns. But in November 2021, he finally made an entry through the transfer site.</p><p>Purdy’s relocation to Nebraska in January 2022 marked a sea change. In his debut, he led the team to a score against No. 6 Oklahoma. He had significant appearances. He made his first career start against Minnesota in spite of ailments and difficulties, showcasing his flexibility with 65 total yards and a touchdown run in the first quarter. Sadly, his progress was halted versus No. 3 Michigan due to an ankle injury that ended the season.</p><p>Purdy started in Week 12 versus Wisconsin despite being Nebraska’s third-string quarterback going into the 2023 campaign. The head coach praised Chubba Purdy’s effort despite the setback, highlighting his versatility and resiliency during his time in college.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Chubba Purdy His Real Name?</h2><p>No, Preston Purdy is Chubba Purdy, not “Chubba” as he was named at birth. He was given the nickname “Chubba” as a youngster because of his plump build. Even though Preston was his birth name, he formally adopted “Chubba” as an adult because that’s how everyone knew him.</p><p>This change is a reflection of the significance of the nickname in his life and his personal relationship to it.
