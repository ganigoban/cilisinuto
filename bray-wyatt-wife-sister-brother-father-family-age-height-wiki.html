Mike who started his wrestling by becoming the heavyweight champion won various championships during his time in the ring including a heavyweight championship of the NWA in Florida.</span></p><p><span>Bray Wyatt’s brother, Taylor Michael Rotunda, is also a more popular wrestler than Bo Dallas.&nbsp;Just as the whole family finds themselves in the world of wrestling, so does Mika Rotunda, Wyatt’s sister.&nbsp;She works as a member of the production team for WrestleMania 33 after starting out as a ring announcer.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Bray Wyatt’s&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>wife</span></strong></h2><p><span>Bray Wyatt has been married since 2012 to Samantha Rotunda.&nbsp;The two met and started dating in college when they were both students at Troy University in Alabama.&nbsp;Their marriage was blessed with two daughters, Kendyl and Cadyn.</span></p><p><span>In April 2017, Samantha Rotunda filed for divorce against her bearded husband claiming that the relationship was irretrievably broken.&nbsp;In her divorce filing, Samantha accused Bray Wyatt of adultery and mischief even as the wrestler denied any wrongdoing.</span></p><p><span>Nonetheless, Samantha went on to claim that Wyatt had an affair with WWE announcer JoJo Offerman.&nbsp;Even after the divorce, it circulated that the wrestler was still reaching out to the advertiser who was on her side in a relationship with fellow wrestler, Jesse White who she had been dating since 2013.</span></p><p><span>After the separation, Samantha Rotunda filed for custody of their children, home, child support and alimony.&nbsp;Alongside the house, she also received a temporary payment of $14,735 from her ex-husband and a payment of $50,000 to take care of her legal expenses.&nbsp;Nonetheless, they are still locked in more battles over paying the monthly fee, as Bray Wyatt was content with only paying $6,000.</span></p><p><span>Since the divorce, it has been reported that while Windham Lawrence Rotunda lived primarily with JoJo Offerman, his wife and children now occupy the family home.&nbsp;This can easily confirm that Offerman and Wyatt are dating.</span></p><h2><strong><span>the size</span></strong></h2><p><span>A dominant figure in the ring, Bray Wyatt has everything for his size and everything that helps him succeed as a wrestler.&nbsp;Here are his body stats:</span></p><p><strong><span>Height:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;6 ft 3 in (1.91 m)</span></p><p><strong><span>Weight:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;285 lbs (129 kg)</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiaopbGbsPYmqutZaees6Z50qKqrZ2iYq%2Bzu9OhnKtllpbBqbHRZp2apZmhxm6txp5koZ2ZnLW1edaioqJn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbray-wyatt-wife-sister-brother-father-family-age-height-wiki.html&text=Bray%20Wyatt%20Wife%2c%20Sister%2c%20Brother%2c%20Father%2c%20Family%2c%20Age%2c%20Height&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbray-wyatt-wife-sister-brother-father-family-age-height-wiki.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbray-wyatt-wife-sister-brother-father-family-age-height-wiki.html&title=Bray%20Wyatt%20Wife%2c%20Sister%2c%20Brother%2c%20Father%2c%20Family%2c%20Age%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbray-wyatt-wife-sister-brother-father-family-age-height-wiki.html&title=Bray%20Wyatt%20Wife%2c%20Sister%2c%20Brother%2c%20Father%2c%20Family%2c%20Age%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbray-wyatt-wife-sister-brother-father-family-age-height-wiki.html&title=Bray%20Wyatt%20Wife%2c%20Sister%2c%20Brother%2c%20Father%2c%20Family%2c%20Age%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbray-wyatt-wife-sister-brother-father-family-age-height-wiki.html&description=Bray%20Wyatt%20Wife%2c%20Sister%2c%20Brother%2c%20Father%2c%20Family%2c%20Age%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./brooke-zimmermans-obituary-cause-of-death-who-was-brooke-zimmerman-what-happened-to-brooke-zimmerman.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brooke Zimmerman's Obituary &amp;amp; Cause Of Death: Who Was Brooke Zimmerman?
