The two are now one of the hottest couples in the Hip-Hop world, welcoming their second child together later this year. Through artistic collaborations and public sightings, there has been almost a decade’s worth of speculation regarding A$AP Rocky and Rihanna’s relationship. Here’s a look at Rocky and Rihanna’s complete relationship timeline.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2012-cockiness-love-it-collaboration>2012: "Cockiness (Love It)" Collaboration</h2></span><p>A$AP Rocky and Rihanna’s first public collaboration came in 2012 when Rocky was featured on a remix of Rihanna’s song "Cockiness (Love It)." The two also performed the song live at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2012. Rocky hugged Rihanna and kissed her on her neck during the performance, yet the two were not together at the time.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2013-rihanna-tour-a-ap-rocky-music-video>2013: Rihanna Tour & A$AP Rocky Music Video</h2></span><p>In 2013, A$AP was featured as the opening act of the North American part of Rihanna’s Diamonds World Tour. Also in 2013, Rihanna was featured in the music video for A$AP’s song "Fashion Killa" off his debut album, LONG.LIVE.A$AP. A$AP also name-drops Rihanna in the song. Her appearance in the video sparked many of the first rumors that the two were dating. However, A$AP shot down the rumors in an interview with Distractify, as he stated, “I don't even look at her like that. She's sexy, but I'm good."</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-december-2019-british-fashion-awards>December 2019: British Fashion Awards</h2></span><p>LONDON, ENGLAND - DECEMBER 02: Rihanna and ASAP Rocky attend The Fashion Awards 2019 at the Royal Albert Hall on December 02, 2019 in London, England. (Photo by Karwai Tang/WireImage)</p><p>Six years after their first musical collaboration, A$AP and Rihanna posed on the red carpet of the British Fashion Awards. However, the two were not a couple at the time. After the event, Rihanna posted a photo on Instagram and thanked A$AP Rocky for supporting her billion-dollar brand. She wrote, "And thank you @asaprocky for representing us on the carpet and always being so supportive of @Fenty!!"</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-january-2020-dating-rumors>January 2020: Dating Rumors</h2></span><p>PARIS, FRANCE - JUNE 21: Rihanna and A$AP Rocky attend the Louis Vuitton Menswear Spring/Summer 2019 show as part of Paris Fashion Week on June 21, 2018 in Paris, France. (Photo by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images)</p><p>Following Rihanna’s split from her rumored partner of three years, Hassan Jameel, gossip once again began to circulate about A$AP. These rumors began after a source told The Sun that they shared a hotel during a trip to New York. The source also stated, "However, Rihanna is reluctant to put a label on it as it’s so soon after Hassan. [But] they’re really enjoying each other’s company and taking things easy as it’s still early days. It’s really casual between them and she’s not thinking about whether there’s a future with Rocky. She’s a newly-single girl having fun."</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2020-spotted-together>2020: Spotted Together</h2></span><p>NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JULY 10: Rihanna and A$AP Rocky are seen on set for a music video on July 10, 2021 in New York City. (Photo by Gotham/GC Images)</p><p>Dating rumors about the pair continued as the two were seen leaving The Nice Guy restaurant in Los Angeles in February 2020. Rihanna and A$AP were also spotted on November 28th at The Beatrice Inn in New York City. A source told People Magazine two days after this that the longtime friends were now a couple. It didn't come as a surprise to fans, considering their long history.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-ap-calls-rihanna-the-love-of-my-life>A$AP Calls Rihanna "The Love Of My Life"</h2></span><p>In an interview with GQ Magazine, Rocky stated that Rihanna was “the love of his life” and also referred to Rihanna as “my lady” while speaking about their relationship. The interviewer mentioned that A$AP “starts beaming like a teenager whose crush just accepted his prom invite” when Rihanna was mentioned. Rocky also spoke on the potential of fatherhood in this interview as he stated, "If that’s in my destiny, absolutely. Nah, but like, I think I’d be an incredible, remarkably, overall amazing dad.” Rocky also confirmed that during this interview, he spent Christmas in Barbados with Rihanna’s family.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-january-2022-baby-on-board>January 2022: Baby On Board</h2></span><p>PARIS, FRANCE - MARCH 01: Rihanna is seen outside the Dior show, during Paris Fashion Week - Womenswear F/W 2022-2023, on March 01, 2022 in Paris, France.

(Photo by Rich Fury/Getty Images for Fenty Beauty & Fenty Skin)</p><p>In an interview with Dazed, Rocky also opened up about his once-private relationship with Rihanna. When discussing the prospect of fatherhood, Rocky stated, "I will always remind my children to never lose their imagination, even as adults, no matter what. I actually love to watch cartoons – I've watched like, Teletubbies, Blue's Clues, Yo Gabba Gabba, Peppa Pig and Baby Shark.” He went on, "I hope to raise open-minded children. Not people who discriminate. And I’m not trying to describe a saint, but realistically, I just want a cool child with cool parents."</p><p>A$AP also spoke on his relationship, stating, "I think it’s just natural. We happen to look good together naturally. You know, it would take a lot of work to have us forcefully match before we leave the house. Sometimes we match to a T, or we just wear the same clothes. If I buy a shirt that she likes, I expect to get it stolen… but then I gotta steal it back."</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-february-2023-british-vogue-feature>February 2023: British Vogue Feature</h2></span><p>Just days after her <a href=# rel>Super Bowl performance</a>, Rihanna graced the cover of British Vogue with A$AP and their son. Rihanna later revealed that she was pregnant at the time of the shoot and did not know it. In the interview with the magazine, Rihanna stated, "We’re best friends with a baby. We have to be on the same page, but we’ve always kind of had that in our relationship. Everything changes when you have a baby, but I wouldn’t say it’s done anything but made us closer."</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-march-2023-the-oscars>March 2023: The Oscars</h2></span><p>HOLLYWOOD, CA - MARCH 12: ASAP Rocky and Rihanna backstage at the 95th Academy Awards at the Dolby Theatre on March 12, 2023 in Hollywood, California.
