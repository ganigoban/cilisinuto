Whether it was a receding hairline, a shiny patch at the crown or general thinning all over, the only way to deal with baldness used to be a razor and a hat. However, today more and more male celebrities are turning to surgeons to help them restore their hair to its full glory. A host of high-profile stars including <a class=hm-link href=#>Wayne Rooney</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Louis Walsh</a> have admitted to undergoing hair transplants – and are looking much younger and fresher for it. The procedure involves either transplanting individual hairs into parts of the head that are experiencing thinning, or grafting strips of skin with hairs growing in them using tiny incisions. Here are eight celebrities who have admitted to undergoing hair transplants.</p><p id=emD6XQ01rN-F data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>A hairstylist reveals the best hairstyle for wearing a face mask - and it's not a Marianne-style fringe</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/25aedb96905a-wayne-rooney-hair-loss-z.jpg><h2>Wayne Rooney</h2><p id=eeLayEOM2cYh data-wc=77>Manchester United star Wayne Rooney underwent a transplant in 2011. He shared the news on Twitter by posting a picture of his scalp, which he captioned: "Just to confirm to all my followers I have had a hair transplant. I was going bald at 25 why not. I’m delighted with the result. It’s still a bit bruised and swollen when it dies down u will be first to see it. Anyone recommend any good hair gel. Haha."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3f32dee0f8d8-jake-quickenden-z.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>Jake Quickenden</h2><p id=eXtK4VN3dCuF data-wc=56>Back in 2017, former X Factor contestant Jake Quickenden uploaded a painful-looking selfie on Instagram, showing his bloodied hairline but assuring his followers that the "swelling and redness" will go down in one week. Jake wrote: "So just in case anyone sees me and thinks it's Frankenstein, I've sorted my hairline out after years of insecurities."</p><p id=evowBsZShWnR data-wc=4>Speaking candidly he said:</p><p id=ewlHRojy-UYX data-wc=124><strong>"People might say your hair was fine and didn't need it, but after years of being really worried about losing my hair, I took the dive and did something about it! I am delighted with how it has turned out! Swelling and redness will go down after a week and then just get on with day to day life and wait for the results!! My old man was bald and it suited him, I shaved my head and I looked like a peanut M&M, so, unfortunately, I don't suit a skinhead.... anyone got any questions just drop me an inbox... I will take any stick anyone wants to give me as well because honestly I'm buzzing and couldn't care less about negative comments!! Peace."</strong></p><p id=eQZWHz0WljjU data-wc=12>After receiving a flurry of support from his fans, Jake later wrote:</p><p id=e7XwBVS2Ddnv data-wc=52><strong>"Just would like to say thanks to everyone for positive comments...

He was fully open with his colleagues about the procedure, jokingly saying: "I keep telling Gary he needs it next. I always clock him glancing at my hair on the show. I’m giving Gary the number so hopefully he can get that bald patch at the back of his head sorted out."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5f1fa64e1471-joe-swash-hair-loss-z.jpg><h2>Joe Swash</h2><p id=eXpJ7dKrFUcH data-wc=87>The former Eastenders actor has admitted to undergoing a hair transplant early in his career after feeling the pressure to look good on screen. "It was for myself and something that I wanted to do, to make me feel better. I was on TV so that might have had something to do with it," he said. "With the job I am doing, being on TV, I wanted to look my best, which is probably not the best way of thinking about it. It's how you feel personally."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0490b44db553-calum-best-hair-loss-z.jpg><h2>Calum Best</h2><p id=eqqGR43o2ukc data-wc=65>The reality star underwent a hair transplant before appearing in Celebrity Big Brother in 2015. "There is no doubt the three procedures have changed my life. No man wants to be bald when he is older,” he said. "I have been losing my hair since my early 20s. Nature's plan was for me to have thin and patchy hair across the top of my scalp."</p><p id=eNA34RyuwirT data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>How to cut men’s hair from home: Expert tips and tools for beginners</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2014a6d03573-james-nesbitt-hair-loss-z.jpg><h2>James Nesbitt</h2><p id=eZSHJfBiMDFk data-wc=86>The Cold Feet actor underwent two hair transplants at Dublin's HRBR clinic and was so happy with the results he even appeared in a video testimonial. The 47-year-old said: "Several years ago, I began losing my hair and like a lot of men it was a major concern to me, in fact it was practically an obsession. Since then I have had two hair transplants and I am very pleased with the results.
