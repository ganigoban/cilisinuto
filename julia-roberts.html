After arriving in the city, she joined Click Modeling Agency and enrolled in acting school. Julia’s older brother, Eric Roberts, and niece, Emma Roberts, are also actresses, however, she was estranged from Eric for several years before 2004.</p><p>After appearing in supporting or co-starring parts in films such as “Mystic Pizza” and “Satisfaction,” she rose to prominence with her Oscar-nominated performance in “Steel Magnolias.” Then, in 1990, she became a tremendous, breakthrough star. Her appearance opposite Richard Gere in “Pretty Woman” launched her career, and for the next decade, she appeared in a new hit movie every year.</p><p>Between 1990 and 2000, she starred in 21 films, including “Flatliners,” “Hook,” “Dying Young,” “Sleeping with the Enemy,” “The Pelican Brief,” “Michael Collins,” “Conspiracy Theory,” “My Best Friend’s Wedding,” “Runaway Bride,” “Notting Hill,” and “Erin Brokovich,” for which she received an Oscar.
