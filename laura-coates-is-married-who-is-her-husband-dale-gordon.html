company like CNN, one of the hottest new stations in the world.&nbsp;Laura Coates works with the network as a legal analyst, which has allowed her to speak to a wide global audience, primarily regarding her views on legalization and the activities of the United States government.&nbsp;She doesn’t just work as a broadcaster, she also enjoys a thriving legal career.&nbsp;Read on to learn more about this woman who made a name for herself in the media and in the legal field.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Life Story and Rise to Fame</span></strong></h2><p><span>On July 11 in a town called St. Paul, located in the state of Minnesota, Laura Coates was born.&nbsp;While most of her childhood was spent in Minnesota, little is known about her and her family.&nbsp;Even the exact year of his birth is also a mystery.&nbsp;It is known, however, that his first degree was obtained at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public Policy at the Ivy League College in Princeton and that it was in Public and International Affairs.&nbsp;The next degree she awarded was the Juris Doctor from the University of Minnesota.</span></p><p><span>Right after graduating from Minnesota, her legal career began with her job as a prosecutor.&nbsp;She spent her time as a Justice Department attorney in the Civil Rights Division;&nbsp;she held this position when George Bush and Barack Obama were presidents of the United States.</span></p><p><span>Coates also worked with the US Attorney for Washington State in the assistant position.&nbsp;While performing this work, she worked on a number of cases which gained popularity for their notoriety.</span></p><p><span>Laura Coates has become much better at her job, thanks to the experience she gained working in the Department of Justice as an assistant state attorney.&nbsp;Following this, she began writing articles and conducting research which was published in renowned journals such as&nbsp;</span><span>The Washington Post</span><span>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;</span><span>Boston Herald.&nbsp;</span><span>In 2016 she published her first book –&nbsp;</span><span>You Have the Right: A Constitutional Guide to Policing.</span></p><p><span>The political atmosphere, the rapid decline in popularity of the police, and a growing interest in legal issues during this period made this book a bestseller.&nbsp;She eventually quit her job as a prosecutor and started her own private practice as an intellectual property lawyer, a job she still does.&nbsp;The same year her book was published, this famous civil rights activist and women’s rights advocate was hired by the news network, CNN, to be one of their legal analysts.&nbsp;Since working in the broadcasting industry, Laura Coates has become more popular and even has her own talk show on the radio.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Laura Coates is married, who is her husband – Dale Gordon?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Despite her massive media presence, Laura Coates has managed to keep her private life out of the public eye.&nbsp;Almost nothing is known about his family, while the date of his marriage has remained secret.&nbsp;However, the general public knows that she is married and many people believe that she is the wife of Dale Gordon, the former footballer who played for more than six teams during a career spanning more than ten years.</span></p><p><span>Neither Gordon nor Coates has quashed this rumor.&nbsp;In March 2018, her two children, a boy and a girl, were featured on her talk show,&nbsp;</span><span>The Laura Coates Show.&nbsp;</span><span>Yes, she told them about the show, a segment that fans seemed to enjoy.&nbsp;Laura then shared a photo of their time at the studio on Instagram.&nbsp;The photo shows the man she is married to but with her back to the camera.</span></p><p><span>The names and dates of birth of his children are also not publicly available.&nbsp;She lives in Washington with her mysterious husband and beautiful children.</span></p><p
