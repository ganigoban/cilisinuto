Geffri Hightower prioritised her studies despite beginning her performing career at the young age of nine. She attended Alexander Hamilton High School, where she graduated with honours before continuing her study at Clark Atlanta University. In a time when famous people frequently divulge too much about their private lives, Geffri chooses to keep her distance. She lets her work speak for itself by keeping her career in the forefront.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Before she became well-known, she had frequent rejection. Fortunately, she continued to pursue her objectives and fulfil her role as an actress.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Geffri-Hightower-1.webp alt="Meet Geffri Hightower: Age, Bio, Career And More Of The American Actress" width=1000 height=1505 data-sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career_Of_Geffri_Hightower></span><b>Career Of</b> <b>Geffri Hightower</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Geffri Hightower was only nine years old when she appeared as Young Nala in the Broadway adaptation of The <a href=#>Lion King</a>.

Her ability to persuade Baker that he is the biological father of her unborn child, despite the fact that Dane Kohler is the genuine father, represents one of the high points in her character growth.</span></p><p><span>In an interview she said, “What are dreams without a journey? With any and every passion or profession, there’s challenges to be met on the way! The biggest challenge thus far within my career is facing rejection! Rejection is something we as artists deal with every day…many for reasons that are beyond our control! But I’ve always been raised to believe and embrace that with rejection comes blessings! What I continue to gain amidst my challenge is that with every door closed, there’s one opening FILLED with endless possibilities and opportunities to carry us on our path of purpose”.</span></p><p><span>She strives hard as an actress to fulfil her role in the entertainment business. She can acquire a lot of roles in films and TV shows as a result.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Is_Geffri_Hightowers_Net_Worth></span><b>What Is Geffri Hightower’s Net Worth?</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Her net worth is estimated to be around $5 million.
