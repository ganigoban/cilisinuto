I did love him so much, I did,” the <a href=#>ITV</a> star continued.</p><p>The Welsh dancer went on to date operations manager Nick Kyriacou on and off until moving onto her current beau and West End co-star Ben Joyce.</p><p>Kem has kept his personal life mostly private since Amber, though he dated law student Lexi Hyzler until December 2020.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-season-4-dani-dyer-and-jack-fincham>Season 4 – Dani Dyer and Jack Fincham</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/07/GettyImages-1074475620-826x1024.jpg><p>Dani Dyer and Jack Fincham dated for nine months before splitting in April 2019.
