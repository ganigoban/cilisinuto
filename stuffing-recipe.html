Well, it’s true! As a kid, I fell in love with my grandma’s stuffing recipe. Made with onion, celery, and dried herbs, it was simple and delicious. It had a crisp, golden layer of bread on top, with a moist and gooey center underneath. Rich, savory flavor filled every bite.</p><p>My mom still makes this homemade stuffing recipe for my family’s Thanksgiving every year. Because I love it so much, I wanted to develop my own spin to share with all of you! I didn’t make many changes – I swapped the onions for leeks and dried herbs for fresh ones, and I used crusty sourdough bread. I was thrilled with the results, but I was nervous to see what my mom would think. When I shared it with her last weekend, I breathed a huge sigh of relief. After a few bites, she looked up and said, “You took our stuffing recipe, and you made it better!” I hope you love it as much as we do.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/stuffing-recipe/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_33007-1.jpg&description=This+classic+stuffing+recipe+is+the+BEST+Thanksgiving+side+dish%21+Made+with+celery%2C+butter%2C+and+herbs%2C+it+has+golden+edges+and+a+soft%2C+flavorful+center.+%7C+Love+and+Lemons+%23stuffing+%23stuffingrecipe+%23thanksgiving+%23sidedish")'></span></span></p><h2>Stuffing Recipe Ingredients</h2><p>Unlike the stuffing recipes I’ve shared in the past (see <a href=#>here</a> or <a href=#>here</a>), this one is fairly traditional. I make it with these basic ingredients:</p><ul><li><strong>Bread</strong>, of course! Steer clear of pre-sliced sandwich bread for this recipe. You want a loaf that’s crusty and flavorful, preferably sourdough. Stale bread works best here, so I recommend buying it one to three days in advance.</li><li><strong>Butter</strong> – It infuses this stuffing with rich, buttery flavor.</li><li><strong>Leeks</strong> – I love their sweet, oniony flavor with the herbs and celery in this recipe. If you don’t cook with leeks often, check out <a href=#>this post</a> to learn how to cut and clean them!</li><li><strong>Celery</strong> – A stuffing essential.</li><li><strong>Garlic</strong> – For sharp depth of flavor.</li><li><strong>Fresh herbs</strong> – Rosemary, sage, thyme, and parsley fill this Thanksgiving stuffing with a mouthwatering mix of earthy, fresh, and savory flavors. You’ll never make stuffing with dried herbs again!</li><li><a href=#><strong>Vegetable broth</strong></a> – To moisten the bread.</li><li><strong>Eggs</strong> – They add richness and moisture, helping to create the stuffing’s irresistible gooey center.</li><li><strong>And sea salt and fresh black pepper</strong> – To make all the flavors pop!</li></ul><p>Find the complete recipe with measurements below.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/stuffing-recipe/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/best-stuffing-recipe.jpg&description=This+classic+stuffing+recipe+is+the+BEST+Thanksgiving+side+dish%21+Made+with+celery%2C+butter%2C+and+herbs%2C+it+has+golden+edges+and+a+soft%2C+flavorful+center.+%7C+Love+and+Lemons+%23stuffing+%23stuffingrecipe+%23thanksgiving+%23sidedish")'></span></span></p><h2>How to Make Stuffing</h2><p>This Thanksgiving stuffing recipe is super simple to make! Here’s how it goes:</p><p><strong>First, tear the bread.</strong> Yes, tear with your hands, not cut with a knife! I prefer the look of torn bread to perfect little bread cubes, and I like how the craggy edges catch the melted butter and herbs. After you tear it, place the bread in a very large bowl.</p><ul><li>Tip:&nbsp;If your bread is not stale, spread the torn pieces in a single layer on a large baking sheet. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in a 350°F oven to dry them out a bit. Then, proceed with the recipe!</li></ul><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/stuffing-recipe/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_33035-1.jpg&description=This+classic+stuffing+recipe+is+the+BEST+Thanksgiving+side+dish%21+Made+with+celery%2C+butter%2C+and+herbs%2C+it+has+golden+edges+and+a+soft%2C+flavorful+center.+%7C+Love+and+Lemons+%23stuffing+%23stuffingrecipe+%23thanksgiving+%23sidedish")'></span></span></p><p><strong>Next, cook the leeks.&nbsp;</strong>Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the leeks, celery, garlic, salt, and pepper, and sauté for 5 minutes, or until the vegetables soften. I turn the heat to low halfway through to avoid browning the leeks.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/stuffing-recipe/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/thanksgiving-stuffing.jpg&description=This+classic+stuffing+recipe+is+the+BEST+Thanksgiving+side+dish%21+Made+with+celery%2C+butter%2C+and+herbs%2C+it+has+golden+edges+and+a+soft%2C+flavorful+center.+%7C+Love+and+Lemons+%23stuffing+%23stuffingrecipe+%23thanksgiving+%23sidedish")'></span></span></p><p><strong>Then, season the bread!&nbsp;</strong>Pour the leek mixture over the bread and add the fresh herbs. Use your hands to toss it all together, coating the bread with the butter and herbs. Pour 1 1/2 cups of the broth over the bread, and toss again. Add the eggs, and toss again. At this stage, the bread should be very moist. If it feels dry at all, add an additional 1/2 cup broth.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/stuffing-recipe/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/homemade-stuffing.jpg&description=This+classic+stuffing+recipe+is+the+BEST+Thanksgiving+side+dish%21+Made+with+celery%2C+butter%2C+and+herbs%2C+it+has+golden+edges+and+a+soft%2C+flavorful+center.+%7C+Love+and+Lemons+%23stuffing+%23stuffingrecipe+%23thanksgiving+%23sidedish")'></span></span></p><p><strong>Finally, bake!&nbsp;</strong>Transfer the bread mixture to a greased baking dish and arrange it in a thick, even layer. Drizzle the top with melted butter, cover, and bake for 30 minutes at 350°F. If you’re like me, and you like your stuffing to have a crispy top, uncover the dish and bake for 5 to 10 minutes more.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/stuffing-recipe/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/thanksgiving-stuffing-recipe.jpg&description=This+classic+stuffing+recipe+is+the+BEST+Thanksgiving+side+dish%21+Made+with+celery%2C+butter%2C+and+herbs%2C+it+has+golden+edges+and+a+soft%2C+flavorful+center.+%7C+Love+and+Lemons+%23stuffing+%23stuffingrecipe+%23thanksgiving+%23sidedish")'></span></span></p><h2>Best Stuffing Recipe Tips</h2><ul><li><strong>Use day-old bread.&nbsp;</strong>This stuffing recipe comes out best when you make it with day- (or days) old bread. Because it’s drier than fresh-baked bread, it really soaks up the flavors of the buttery leeks, broth, and herbs. So plan ahead! Buy or <a href=#>make your bread</a> one to three days in advance.</li><li><strong>Uncover the pan for a crispy top.&nbsp;</strong>One of my favorite things about Thanksgiving stuffing is how the crispy top contrasts with the moist, gooey inside. To get the top of your stuffing nice and crisp, uncover the casserole dish for the last few minutes of baking.</li><li><strong>Make it ahead.&nbsp;</strong>Who doesn’t love a Thanksgiving recipe that can be made ahead of time?! If you want to prep this recipe a few hours in advance, follow it as written, stopping right before you bake the stuffing. Cover the baking dish, and stick it in the fridge. Pop it in the oven 30-40 minutes before your meal so that it’s hot when you eat. If you’d rather make your stuffing a full day in advance, that works too! Then, fully bake the stuffing ahead of time, but leave it covered for the entire time it’s in the oven. Refrigerate it overnight. The next day, reheat it, still covered, in a 350°F oven until it’s warmed through. Uncover it for the last few minutes of baking to get the top nice and crisp.</li><li><strong>Double it if you need to.&nbsp;</strong>If you’re feeding a crowd of stuffing lovers, or if you want to have plenty of leftovers, go ahead and double this recipe. It’s enough for 8 decent-sized portions, but you might want seconds. At least, I always do. 🙂</li></ul><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/stuffing-recipe/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/stuffing-recipe.jpg&description=This+classic+stuffing+recipe+is+the+BEST+Thanksgiving+side+dish%21+Made+with+celery%2C+butter%2C+and+herbs%2C+it+has+golden+edges+and+a+soft%2C+flavorful+center.+%7C+Love+and+Lemons+%23stuffing+%23stuffingrecipe+%23thanksgiving+%23sidedish")'></span></span></p><h2>More Favorite Thanksgiving Recipes</h2><p>You could make this stuffing recipe anytime during the fall or winter, but it’s perfect for Thanksgiving.

Pour 1½ cups of the broth evenly over the stuffing and toss to coat. Add the eggs and toss again. The bread should feel pretty wet. If it’s still a bit dry, mix in the remaining ½ cup of broth.
