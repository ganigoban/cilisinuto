His net worth could be expected to be a small amount in the years to come as his profile continues to rise.&nbsp;Gathegi has also received a number of awards and nominations throughout his career.&nbsp;One of them is his award for Leading Role at the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Awards.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family – girlfriend, wife</span></strong></h2><p><span>Edi Gathegi looks like a little lady is known about his private life.&nbsp;The talented actor has kept his personal life very personal, deterring distress from media sources.&nbsp;Despite his friendliness to the ladies, Gathegi, the middle child in his family, never showed up to any lady.&nbsp;This may mean that he is not in a romantic relationship with anyone.&nbsp;The verifiable information about Gathegi is that he is not married at the moment and has no child of his own.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height, weight, body stats</span></strong></h2><p><span>Edi Gathegi has a good stature which perfectly matches his acting profession.&nbsp;He stands at a height of 6′ 1” which is quite proportional to his weight of 59 kg.&nbsp;From the description it can be deduced that the slim figure of the actor undoubtedly gives him an advantage over his peers.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMnpuiZZeWwamxxqJkoKGiobOztcSnm2avmZuybrLApqClsV2XvKXFjKyrmqyjYrWmtcahq2g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-edi-gathegi-girlfriend-wife-family-body-stats-height.html&text=Who%20is%20Edi%20Gathegi%3fGirlfriend%2c%20wife%2c%20family%2c%20body%20stats%2c%20height&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-edi-gathegi-girlfriend-wife-family-body-stats-height.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-edi-gathegi-girlfriend-wife-family-body-stats-height.html&title=Who%20is%20Edi%20Gathegi%3fGirlfriend%2c%20wife%2c%20family%2c%20body%20stats%2c%20height" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-edi-gathegi-girlfriend-wife-family-body-stats-height.html&title=Who%20is%20Edi%20Gathegi%3fGirlfriend%2c%20wife%2c%20family%2c%20body%20stats%2c%20height" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-edi-gathegi-girlfriend-wife-family-body-stats-height.html&title=Who%20is%20Edi%20Gathegi%3fGirlfriend%2c%20wife%2c%20family%2c%20body%20stats%2c%20height" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-edi-gathegi-girlfriend-wife-family-body-stats-height.html&description=Who%20is%20Edi%20Gathegi%3fGirlfriend%2c%20wife%2c%20family%2c%20body%20stats%2c%20height" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-sad-in-dark-explainer.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why do I feel sad during winter?
