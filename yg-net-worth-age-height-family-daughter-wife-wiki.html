The album was originally supposed to be released in 2012 as&nbsp;</span><span>I’m 4rm Bompton,</span><span>&nbsp;but after several delays to the label that was going to release it, it was held up and came out two years later than planned with the new title&nbsp;</span><span>My Life From Krazy</span><span>.&nbsp;One of the titles of the album entitled&nbsp;</span><span>Who do you like?&nbsp;</span><span>, featured Drake in it and was produced by DJ Mustard.&nbsp;The song peaked at number 19 on the US&nbsp;</span><span>Billboard</span><span>&nbsp;Hot 100 .</span></p><p><span>YG’s second studio album was released on June 17, 2016 and is titled&nbsp;</span><span>Encore</span><span>&nbsp;Brazy.&nbsp;The album featured Canadian rapper Drake among other artists.&nbsp;In 2018, he dropped his third album,&nbsp;</span><span>Stay Dangerous</span><span>.&nbsp;He first announced the album’s release on his Instagram page ahead of its eventual release.</span></p><p><span>YG’s fourth studio album was originally slated to be released on April 12, 2019, as announced on his Twitter page, but following the death of his close friend, Nipsey Hussle, YG was forced to postpone the release date of the album.</span></p><p><span>As an actor, he starred in 5 films.&nbsp;The first was in&nbsp;</span><span>We Party</span><span>, a 2012 film in which he starred as C.C. The same year, he played a cameo role as a student in&nbsp;</span><span>Mac & Devin Go to High School</span><span>.&nbsp;The film stars rap stars Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa in the lead role, Mac and Devin.&nbsp;He has also featured in&nbsp;</span><span>White T, blame it the street</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>White boy rick</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>YG’s only known source of income is his rap music.&nbsp;He is not registered as a commercial brand ambassador.&nbsp;As of last review, his net worth was estimated at $3 million.&nbsp;However, that number is expected to increase in the coming years as he releases more albums and eventually starts working with brands.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family, wife, daughter</span></strong></h2><p><span>The known members of the rapper’s family are his Shonee Jackson, his mom Catelyn Starks and his daughter Harmony.&nbsp;The rapper is not yet married, but he is dating the mother of his child, Catelyn Starks.&nbsp;Together they have a three-year-old named Harmony.</span></p><h2><strong><span>YG Height, weight, measurements</span></strong></h2><p><span>YG has a masculine appearance and a body full of tattoos.&nbsp;He is 1.78m tall and weighs 150 lbs.&nbsp;Her chest size is 40 inches.&nbsp;He has an arm height of 14 inches and a waist of 32 inches.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGixl2K7psCMsKarrJhirqixjKGcop%2BYqXqnrcyio7JllJbCqLTTnqlmr5mbsm7DyKSgaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fyg-net-worth-age-height-family-daughter-wife-wiki.html&text=YG%20%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Family%2c%20Daughter%2c%20Wife&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fyg-net-worth-age-height-family-daughter-wife-wiki.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fyg-net-worth-age-height-family-daughter-wife-wiki.html&title=YG%20%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Family%2c%20Daughter%2c%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fyg-net-worth-age-height-family-daughter-wife-wiki.html&title=YG%20%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Family%2c%20Daughter%2c%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fyg-net-worth-age-height-family-daughter-wife-wiki.html&title=YG%20%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Family%2c%20Daughter%2c%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fyg-net-worth-age-height-family-daughter-wife-wiki.html&description=YG%20%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Family%2c%20Daughter%2c%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./leather-jacket-styles-8547905.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="13 Leather Jacket Styles That Are Always On Trend">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./wwe-apparently-using-mojo-rawley-only-during-commercial-breaks-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="WWE Apparently Using Mojo Rawley Only During Commercial Breaks Now">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
