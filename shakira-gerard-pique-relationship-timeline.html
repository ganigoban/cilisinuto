But no, it's real. And what's also real is the disappointment to see something as sacred and as special as I thought was the relationship I had with my kids' father and see that turned into something vulgarized and cheapened by the media.

And I did it. I put my career in second gear and I came to Spain, to support him so he could play football and win titles. And it was a sacrifice of love," Shakira said. "Thanks to that, my kids were able to have a present mom, and I have this amazing bond with them that is unbreakable and that sustains us. You know, that is it. That's all I can say."</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">June 2022: They call it quits.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To fans' surprise, the singer and soccer star dropped the sudden news that they had broken up after 12 years together.
