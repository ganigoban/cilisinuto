It became a hit in no time, reaching platinum and paving the way for her next album,&nbsp;</span><span>3:36 Rule</span><span>&nbsp;released in 2000, which outperformed the first.</span></p><p><span>Pain is Love</span><span>&nbsp;is his next album, released in 2001. This became another very successful album which outsold those before.&nbsp;The single,&nbsp;</span><span>Always On Time</span><span>&nbsp;which featured Ashanti became one of the most popular songs from the album which was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 2002 Grammy Awards.</span></p><p><span>His next albums were&nbsp;</span><span>The Last Temptation</span><span>&nbsp;(2002),&nbsp;</span><span>Blood in My Eyes</span><span>&nbsp;(2003), and&nbsp;</span><span>RULE.&nbsp;</span><span>(2004).&nbsp;He would do other releases, but nothing was as successful as his previous albums.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Woman, Children, Gay</span></strong></h2><p><span>In 2013, rumors emerged claiming that the rapper is gay.&nbsp;Nevertheless, there is no confirmation to this and he is married to Aisha Murray.&nbsp;The couple first met when she was 14-year-old Aisha while still in high school and they have stuck together ever since.</span></p><p><span>Their relationship has not been without its challenges but Aisha Murray Atkins and Jeffrey Atkins are still together and in 1995 they gave birth to a child, Brittany.&nbsp;Their next children, Jeffery Junior and Jordan were born in 2000 and 2005 respectively.</span></p><p><span>There were times when it was speculated that the couple could be set to divorce after it was rumored that Ja Rule cheated on his wife and was gay.&nbsp;Despite everything, the couple is still going strong.</span></p><h2><strong><span>What happened to him?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Even after achieving the same success as him, rapper Ja Rule quickly disappeared from the hip-hop scene after his numerous legal battles which had seen him spend some time behind bars, as well as his endless feuds with other rappers, which turned out to be his downfall.</span></p><p><span>Among his first major feud was with 50 Cent and the feud would turn into a beef with the entire G-Unit.&nbsp;In 2002, 50 Cent signed with Shady Records and Aftermath and the move angered Ja Rule who threatened.&nbsp;He attacked Dr. Dre, Eminem and Eminem’s daughter, Hailie Jade, and many believe that his constant feuds with other rappers led to his downfall in the music industry.</span></p><p><span>While it has become very difficult for him to make a significant impact on the rap scene, Jeffery Atkins has been an actor for a long time.&nbsp;He has starred in a number of films such as&nbsp;</span><span>Ride</span><span>&nbsp;it (2000),&nbsp;</span><span>The Fast and the Furious</span><span>&nbsp;(2001),&nbsp;</span><span>Dead Past</span><span>&nbsp;(2002),&nbsp;</span><span>I’m in Love with a Church Girl</span><span>&nbsp;(2013), and&nbsp;</span><span>Fly</span><span>&nbsp;(2018 ).&nbsp;).</span></p><h2><strong><span>the size</span></strong></h2><p><span>Ja Rule is not only a thick-voiced man, but he’s also a good-sized, weighty man.&nbsp;He is 1.75 m (5 ft 9 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb).</span></p><p class=postsid
