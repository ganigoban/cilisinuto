I love that it can serve a group for a special breakfast or brunch, but it‚Äôs also the kind of thing that you can make on a weekend and reheat on busy mornings throughout the week. This blueberry baked oatmeal is made with healthy ingredients‚Äîthink fresh fruit, almond butter, and whole rolled oats‚Äîbut it tastes like a treat. The top is toasty and nutty, featuring a layer of pecans and coconut flakes that crisp up beautifully in the oven. The middle, on the other hand, stays soft and creamy,‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>‚ÄúI walked outside and felt like I was swimming,‚Äù is what Jack said the other day as I picked him up from the airport, fresh off a flight from LA. It‚Äôs humid here, to say the least, and the air is thick. It‚Äôs the kind of heat that sort of takes your breath away as soon as you walk out the door. But I‚Äôm not complaining, it always takes just a few weeks for the body to acclimate&nbsp;to our summer temps. Hydration is the key. Eight glasses of water (don‚Äôt know who recommended that) is just not enough, so I‚Äôve‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Happy first week of spring! With summer on the horizon, at least in my still-Austin-based mindset, I really want to be making lighter and brighter food. But then I‚Äôm reminded that it still snowed here last week. Sooooo‚Ä¶ a creamy pasta bake it is! This veggie-ful dish is hearty yet cheese-less ‚Äì it won‚Äôt weigh you down, but it will fill you up! Instead of a bunch of cheese and cream, I used my secret creamy blender sauce: almonds, Almond Breeze almondmilk, white miso paste, garlic, lemon juice for tang, and a bit of Dijon mustard for the depth you‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Nothing says love like a smoothie, right? üôÇ I love love love Valentine‚Äôs Day, but not in the fancy-dinner-prix-fixe dinner sort of way. I love it for of all of the cute things that remind me of being a little kid‚Ä¶ tiny paper cards, homemade cupcakes with pink frosting, heart shaped candies‚Ä¶ so in the spirit of being crafty, I made this 3-layer fruit smoothie! I always see layered fruit smoothies on Instagram and think, ‚Äúwho the heck has time to make three separate smoothies?‚Äù ‚Äì but here I am doing it. It actually was pretty simple, and while I‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Before I tell you about this recipe, I wanted to make a quick announcement to our Chicago friends ‚Äì this Saturday I‚Äôll be attending the Renegade Craft Fair Chicago at the Quaker Oats booth. Stop by to say HI and enjoy a healthy snack of Overnight Oats. I‚Äôll be doing the meet & greet from 11:30am ‚Äì 12:30pm, hope to see you there! (click here for details) Ok, back to the recipe! Last week, I was up to my ears in corn‚Ä¶ this week, I‚Äôve been eating blueberries until I‚Äôm blue in the face. They‚Äôre so good right now! Plus,‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Every so often,&nbsp;I get on these mean green daily smoothie kicks that, in all honesty, can get a little TOO green over time. The kick starts with&nbsp;delicious well-balanced smoothies, but as the days go on, I&nbsp;start cutting corners. I add too much liquid so that the blender will blend fast, leaving me with a watery smoothie. And speaking of water, that‚Äôs what I use when I run out of almond milk. I add ice in the name of ‚Äúthickness,‚Äù and I start skipping all ingredients that actually add flavor. What I (we) are left with to drink first thing in‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>There‚Äôs a vegan restaurant that we love in Chicago called The Chicago Diner. Jack and I make it a point to stop there nearly every time we‚Äôre in town. The food is really good, but the thing to get there&nbsp;is the vegan milkshake ‚Äì the peanut butter chocolate chip cookie dough milkshake to be exact.&nbsp;And yes, it‚Äôs as decadent as it sounds. A&nbsp;few weeks ago, we ate lunch there and I tried&nbsp;to not order one. Then Jack‚Äôs shake came to the table and I&nbsp;said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just have one little sip‚Ä¶&nbsp;ok, well maybe just one more‚Ä¶‚Äù&nbsp;and before I had stolen&nbsp;nearly his‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Muffins have such a special place in my heart. Growing up, my family ate muffins for breakfast&nbsp;nearly every day, and it was awesome. My sister and I would *think* we wanted the colorful cereals that the other kids had. We‚Äôd beg my mom to buy them and when she would,&nbsp;they‚Äôd end up going stale on the top shelf in the pantry. Nothing beat a warm muffin and a big glass of milk first thing in the morning. Of course, I‚Äôve since nixed the milk part,&nbsp;but my love for muffins continues. These mango and coconut muffins are my new favorite&nbsp;morning treat.‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I think there are 2 types of people in this world ‚Äì those who love tuna salad and those who hate it. Because my mom made it all the time when I was growing up, I definitely fall into the first category. But today, I‚Äôm hoping to bridge the ‚Äúhater‚Äù gap with these chickpea salad lettuce wraps. If you‚Äôre not into fishy things, no worries, these wraps are completely vegan. If you are into fishy things, I think you‚Äôll love them just the same ‚Äì mashed chickpeas combined with salty, briny flavors (i.e. good Dijon mustard, capers, and cornichons) and‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I have to admit something to you. This food blog job isn‚Äôt always as&nbsp;glamorous as you may think it is. It‚Äôs a job, like any job, with fun parts (cooking! eating!) and less fun parts that involve sitting behind a computer monitor, editing, writing, emailing, etc. It‚Äôs not a sad life by any stretch, but it‚Äôs also not glitz and glory ‚Äì it‚Äôs&nbsp;work. Except‚Ä¶ when some of the opportunities that come my way are totally out of left field ‚Äì and I find myself going to California for a day touring an absolutely beautiful almond orchard instead of touring Adobe‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Happy Saturday friends! We‚Äôre currently having a lazy morning that‚Äôs consisted of smoothies and Shark Tank‚Ä¶ a.k.a our Saturday morning ‚Äúcartoon.‚Äù It‚Äôs dark and drizzly outside, so we‚Äôre likely not leaving the house anytime soon. I thought I‚Äôd take a second to pop in and share this super simple turmeric latte recipe. I posted it on Instagram earlier this week, but I thought I‚Äôd share it here too. Earlier this year, I stopped drinking *so much* coffee (not that I feel there‚Äôs anything wrong with coffee!) and started drinking more matcha.
