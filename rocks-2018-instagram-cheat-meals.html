He is not only the People’s Champion, but he is a shoo-in for the WWE Hall Of Fame. He also stays in remarkable shape.<br>Dwayne Johnson needs to keep a strict diet and exercise program to stay so jacked. This routine involves stepping out of his diet every now and then for a massive cheat meal.<br>If you follow The Great One on Instagram, then you’re aware of the fact that he often posts pictures of his cheat meals for all to see. We’re fascinated to see what the Brahma Bull is doing to cheat on his diet, and it’s even more interesting to see what he’s up to while consuming such a huge meal.<br>Therefore, we’ve collected all of The Rock’s Instagram cheat meals from 2018 (so far). Enjoy.<br><strong>January 29th</strong><br>The Rock started off the cheat meal year on January 29th. He loves brownies and cookies. You will see a lot more of those as time goes on. Needless to say, The Rock doesn’t do just normal brownies and cookies either.</p><p>“(I do share recipes in exchange for dirty jokes and tequila)<br>I make my cheat meals EPIC because, hell we all work hard and only live once.<br>Huge turkey subs – oven roasted turkey, provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato onion and mayo on the side.<br>Huge fudge brownies with milk chocolate chips, natural peanut butter and fudge smothered and drizzled on top.<br>A beautiful night of decadence and sin and by 2am I was drenched in sugar sweats trying to sleep.<br>But much like the many addictions I have in my life – the going up is always worth the coming down. “</p><p>As you can see, Rocky also loves sandwiches. Sometimes it’s not fair how well he is able to describe the food he’s eating either. It’s like he’s auditioning for some kind of a cooking show.<br><br><strong>March 26th</strong><br>The Rock was too busy in February and most of March to post a cheat meal, He had Rampage business to take care of, but he destroyed some pancakes in a way that most mortal men wouldn’t dare. After such a hard day by 2:00 am, The Great One needed the fuel to carry on. All of this makes us wonder how he finds the time to sleep at all.</p><p>“Veni, vini, vici.<br>Well earned late Sunday night cheat meal.<br>Sush and banana, chocolate chip pancakes.<br>Hello sugar sweats by 2am.<br>#CameSawConquered”</p><p>This is a very impressive meal, but if you keep going on this list the best is yet to come in regards to the massive amount of food The Rock is able to consume.<br><br><br><strong><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>June 18th</span></span></strong><br>The Rock enjoyed a mid-Summer cheat meal in a huge way while he had some laughs thanks to Ali Wong.</p><p><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>“It’s on – Sunday cheat meal.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>Chocolate chip banana pancakes, syrup, peanut butter and&nbsp;@aliwong.

Thankfully, he has a team ready to help get him through his difficult itinerary. He also has plenty of food too.</span></span><br><br><strong><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>July 29th</span></span></strong><br>The Rock enjoys his sushi and he also loves his cookies in a big way. The Great One showed off his cheat meal while talking about his “succulent” meal in a way that could make anyone envious.</p><p><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>“*swipe left and witness the double main-eventer of cheat meals while I get my Netflix fix.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>6pm – the succulent sushi&nbsp;train rolls thru and right into my belly.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>11pm – homemade cheatin’ chocolate chip cookies &nbsp;with a one-way ticket to Holy Moses heaven by smearing peanut butter on every cookie before I destroy them.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>I know how to party.

It’s pretty interesting to be able to get a peek in on what kind of massive meals he’s consuming. He considers this “food porn” and it’s hard to argue with that.<br><br><strong><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>August 20th</span></span></strong><br>The Rock paid tribute to Garry Shandling while he ate a boatload of sushi. The secret sauce to success might be different for everyone. Thankfully, The Rock’s secret sauce has been enjoyed by millions and millions of his fans for decades.</p><p><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>“Sunday sushi express rolls along..</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>With a phenomenal doc on legendary comedian, Garry Shandling.

He is obviously a favorite of The Great One’s because he’s referenced Rogers a couple of times before.</span></span></p><p><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>“1am and the cheat meal sushi train&nbsp;rolls along like an unstoppable force.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>Despite the fact that I wound up passed out on the couch like a wounded buffalo after destroying sushi — this documentary WONT YOU BE MY NEIGHBOR? about the iconic “Mr. Rogers” is excellent.

This is good to hear and it is just one more thing he has in common with his millions and millions of his fans.</span></span><br><br><strong><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>September 24th</span></span></strong><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>The Rock absolutely demolished a huge plate of sushi and then followed it up with too many </span></span><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>cookies to</span></span><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88> count. He has expensive tastes, but he can certainly afford it.</span></span><br><br><br><br><strong><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>October 1st</span></span></strong><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>It’s midnight for The Great One which means it’s all aboard the sushi train for Dwayne Johnson. He also mused a little bit about The Defiant Ones which he was just getting around to watching.</span></span></p><p><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>“Midnight.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>By any means necessary.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>Just cuz I’m in London, doesn’t mean my Sunday Sushi Train&nbsp;doesn’t roll on.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>Shout to my ace/partner in crime, Emily Blunt for the soosh recommendation.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>Polished it off w/ my signature double stuffed chocolate and peanut butter chip cookies with real peanut butter in the middle.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>I’m late to the game on watching this doc, but THE DEFIANT ONES w/ Dr Dre & Jimmy Iovine is a must see.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>When I was a kid I heard a quote, that stuck with me for life – once you’ve been hungry, you’ll never be full.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>Cheers boys &nbsp;to never being full and always being the hardest worker in the room. “</span></span></p><p><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>The Rock’s busy schedule doesn’t give a lot of time for Netflix and chill, but at least he does have time for Netflix and cheat meals.</span></span><br><br><strong><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>October 6th</span></span></strong><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>The Rock was looking to “bring gluttony to a whole new level.” with this </span></span><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>cheat</span></span><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>&nbsp;meal on the sushi train.

Those pizzas didn’t stand a chance though.</span></span><br><br><strong><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>November 19th</span></span></strong><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>The Rock enjoyed a huge plate of sushi and then he let us know about his appreciation for the late great Johnny Cash. He quoted the legendary country singer while he slammed some sushi. That’s quite a picture.</span></span></p><p><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>“The cheat meal Sunday Sushi Train rolled on this past weekend with some power and a ton of that wooosabi</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>Great new doc on Netflix about one of my fav country artists, the icon himself, Johnny Cash.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>I wear the black for the poor and beaten down.. livin’ in the hopeless, hungry side of town.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>If you ain’t eatin’ – then you ain’t cheatin’. Enjoy your cheat meals my friends and excuse me while I take greed and gluttony to new levels.”</span></span></p><p><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>Knowing some of the people The Rock draws inspiration from is a pretty cool little tidbit that he lets the fans in on. As Dwayne Johnson, he’s an even bigger star and has gone on to influence countless others outside of pro wrestling. It’s nice to know that even people like The People’s Champion have influences just like the rest of us.</span></span><br><br><strong><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>November 23rd</span></span></strong><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>Okay, so this is Thanksgiving so it shouldn’t count, but you’ve got to see this bird.</span></span></p><p><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>“Word to the bird</span></span><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>&nbsp;and a weird thing I have to always keep close.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>This Thanksgiving was a unique one, in that it was the first time I’ve ever not been back home in the U.S. of A.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>But here in London, we still cooked and laid out a big, sweet spread to give our thanks and boundless gratitude for our loved ones.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>The weird thing – is every Thanksgiving I gotta take a moment to remember exactly 27 years ago on Thanksgiving while living in Tampa, Fl we were so piss broke, that we couldn’t even afford to buy a turkey, so we were praying someone would invite us over for Thanksgiving.</span></span><br>Well, the universe answered our prayers, because friends of ours called to say Happy Thanksgiving and we were like, “HAPPY THANKSGIVING WE’LL BE RIGHT OVER TO CELEBRATE WITH YOU GUYS K BYE!!” They were like, “Uhhh okaaaay great, see you soon?” A Very true and f*cking embarrassing story<br>I’m weird this way, but remembering sh*t like this helps me live a better and more grateful life.<br>I’m quite sure I need therapy for this, but until then tequila will be my loving & empathetic therapist.”</p><p><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>What a great Thanksgiving story from The Rock. It’s been a while since he led us all in a story-time.</span></span><br><br><br><strong><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>December 3rd</span></span></strong><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>While enjoying some of the amazing Dave Attell and Jeff Ross, The Rock destroyed an entire plate of cookies. It was quite an endeavor, but we’re glad to be along for at least the start of this ride.</span></span></p><p>“The&nbsp;#CheatMealCookieTrain&nbsp;rolls on with my DJ signature milk chocolate chip, salted caramel chip jumbo cookies with a shit load of peanut butter and guilt in the middle.<br>Enjoyin’ my cookie gluttony watching a&nbsp;@netflix&nbsp;special I HIGHLY RECOMMEND if you like love your comedy raw, like I do – “Bumping Mics” with two of my fav comedians&nbsp;@therealjeffreyross&nbsp;&&nbsp;@daveattell.<br>I did a show with Jeffery a few years ago for our military at Pearl Harbor, called&nbsp;#RockTheTroops. This sumbitch called me Harambe and 50,000 troops roared with laughter and I thought I re-tore my surgically repaired hernias cause I was laughing so f*cking hard.<br>Jeffery and Dave have GREAT CHEMISTRY together… reminds me of me and my incestuous biscuit sh*t of a son”</p><p><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>That Harambe line had us laughing and we weren’t even there to see it go down live. It just goes to show that The Rock has some really cool friends.</span></span><br><br><strong><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>December 9th</span></span></strong><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>The Rock ate a ton of sushi and two huge sandwiches. He also included a note in typical Rock Fashion to introduce us to his cheat meal.</span></span></p><p><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>“The Sunday Sushi Train&nbsp;brought a friend to ride.. a big ass roasted turkey, smoked ham and cheese sammich hand made by yours truly.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>Satisfying my addiction, with a great doc called UNDER THE INFLUENCE about one of the greatest guitarists of all time, Keith Richards.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>If you ain’t eatin’ then you ain’t cheatin’. Enjoy, your cheat meals my friends.”</span></span></p><p><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>It’s interesting how he’s not watching RAW in any of these posts.</span></span><br><br><strong><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>December 10th</span></span></strong><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>The Rock loves his cookies and when he eats them he goes all out. He also doesn’t skimp on the ingredients&nbsp;so every cookie is like a full dessert.</span></span></p><p><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>“And the insane cheat meal cookie train rolls on</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>Start with 15 ginormous “DJ Heavens” of milk chocolate and salted caramel chips with peanut butter in the middle.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>Insanity rolls on with one of the wildest docs I’ve seen in some time, THREE IDENTICAL STRANGERS.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>Nature vs Nurture.

Luckily, he’s just talking about cookies in this instance.</span></span><br><br><strong><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>December 23rd</span></span></strong><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>This is the last one he’s posted so far. It’s been a pretty big year for The Rock and his cheat meals. So he celebrated another huge sushi plate in style. Along with a ton of sushi, The Great One Wrote:</span></span></p><p><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>“3:45am. F*ck it. Can’t sleep.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>But that ain’t stoppin’ my sushi train from rollin’ on.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>Just watched one of the greatest performances I’ve ever seen.&nbsp;#SpringsteenOnBroadway&nbsp;from the boss himself, Bruce Springsteen.</span></span><br><span class=acsse9c88><span class=acsse9c88>Never met him, but look forward to sharing a drink one day with this man and choppin’ up our lives — two very lucky, hard workin’ SOB’s.

Sushi is delicious.
