Wham! was a British pop sensation in the 1980s, known for hits like “Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go,” “Careless Whisper,” and “Last Christmas.” While George Michael was recognized for his vocal talent and charisma, Andrew played a significant role in the band’s image and songwriting. So, what happened to Andrew from Wham! after the band’s split in 1986?</p><h2 id=early-life-and-formation-of-wham-mKPpKEfkfN>Early Life and Formation of Wham!</h2><p>Andrew Ridgeley was born on January 26, 1963, in Windlesham, Surrey, England. He met George Michael at Bushey Meads School, and they formed a fast friendship over a shared love of music. This bond led to the creation of Wham! in 1981. The duo quickly rose to fame with their catchy tunes and vibrant music videos.</p><h2 id=the-success-of-wham-mKPpKEfkfN>The Success of Wham!</h2><p>Wham! became one of the most popular musical acts of the 80s, with a string of chart-topping hits. Andrew’s role in the band was often seen as the instrumentalist and backing vocalist, complementing George’s lead vocals. However, his contribution to the band’s style and energy was significant.</p><h2 id=the-split-of-wham-and-aftermath-mKPpKEfkfN>The Split of Wham! and Aftermath</h2><p>In 1986, at the height of their fame, Wham! disbanded. George Michael wanted to pursue a solo career, which led to international success. Andrew, on the other hand, took a different path.</p><h2 id=andrew-ridgeleys-solo-career-mKPpKEfkfN>Andrew Ridgeley’s Solo Career</h2><p>After the split, Andrew released a solo album, “Son of Albert,” in 1990. However, the album did not achieve the success he had with Wham! and received mixed reviews. This marked the beginning of a relatively quiet period in his music career.</p><h2 id=life-beyond-the-music-industry-mKPpKEfkfN>Life Beyond the Music Industry</h2><p>Following his brief solo career, Andrew Ridgeley moved away from the forefront of the music scene. He pursued various interests, including acting, environmental activism, and even tried his hand at Formula Three motor racing.</p><h2 id=personal-life-mKPpKEfkfN>Personal Life</h2><p>Andrew has largely kept his personal life private. He had a long-term relationship with Keren Woodward, a member of the band Bananarama, though they reportedly split in 2017 after 25 years together.</p><h2 id=occasional-public-appearances-mKPpKEfkfN>Occasional Public Appearances</h2><p>Despite his retreat from the public eye, Andrew has made occasional appearances. He has participated in interviews and events that honor George Michael’s legacy, especially after George’s untimely death in 2016.</p><h2 id=andrews-role-in-remembering-george-michael-mKPpKEfkfN>Andrew’s Role in Remembering George Michael</h2><p>Andrew has been vocal about preserving the memory of his friend and former bandmate.

George & Me,” which details his experiences in Wham! and his relationship with George Michael. The book offers a rare glimpse into the private life of the pop duo.</p><h2 id=andrews-continued-influence-mKPpKEfkfN>Andrew’s Continued Influence</h2><p>Although Andrew Ridgeley may not be a regular fixture in the music industry today, his influence and contributions to Wham!’s legacy are undeniable. He remains a figure of interest for fans of the iconic 80s band.</p><h2 id=philanthropy-and-charity-work-mKPpKEfkfN>Philanthropy and Charity Work</h2><p>Andrew has also been involved in various charitable endeavors over the years, supporting causes close to his heart and continuing to make a positive impact outside of the music industry.</p><h2 id=media-portrayal-and-public-perception-mKPpKEfkfN>Media Portrayal and Public Perception</h2><p>The media has often portrayed Andrew as the “other half” of Wham!, with much of the spotlight on George Michael. However, fans and those who have followed his career know that his role in the band was more than just a supporting act.</p><h2 id=andrews-musical-legacy-mKPpKEfkfN>Andrew’s Musical Legacy</h2><p>While Andrew Ridgeley may not have a vast catalog of solo work, his contributions to Wham!’s music have left a lasting impression on pop culture.
